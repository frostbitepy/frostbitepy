## 🏗️ Featured Work at Núcleo S.A.
### 🔎 **Automated Data Validation System (Owner / Developer)**
A completely automated validation pipeline integrated into Airflow’s daily ingestion DAGS. Once each table is migrated from on‑prem PostgreSQL to BigQuery, this validator runs four validation stages:

1. **Row Counts Validation**
2. **Numeric Sum Validation**
3. **Date Range Validation**
4. **Null Checks**

📌 **Highlights**:
- Parameterized design using metadata tables in BigQuery
- Fully modeled and implemented from scratch (tables, logic, pipeline)
- CI/CD workflow with GitLab (branches, dev → prod deployments)
- Validation results stored in structured BigQuery tables
- Results visualized in **Looker Studio**, with dashboards I designed
